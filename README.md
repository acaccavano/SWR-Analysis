# SWR-Analysis;
Suite of MATLAB algorithms (recommended to be used with App Designer GUI) 
for the analysis and coincidence detection of local field sharp wave ripples (SWRs), 
local field oscillations (theta, gamma, etc.), spikes (SWR coincidence and 
spike-phase coupling), post-synaptic currents (PSCs), and calcium transients.

Written in MATLAB 2022a Update 4
