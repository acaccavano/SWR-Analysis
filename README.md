# SWR-Analysis;
Suite of MATLAB algorithms (optionally called with an App Designer GUI) 
for the analysis and coincidence detection of local field sharp wave ripples (SWRs), 
local field oscillations (theta, gamma, etc.), spikes (SWR coincidence and 
spike-phase coupling), post-synaptic currents (PSCs), and calcium transients.

Written in MATLAB 2020b Update 5
